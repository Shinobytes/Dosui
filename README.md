# Codename Dosui or Shinobytes.Console.Forms

![](https://github.com/zerratar/Shinobytes.Console.Forms/blob/master/samples/Screenshots/0.png)

Name not yet finalized, hence both combinations are available.

Dosui is an UI Framework similar to System.Windows.Forms but for Consoles, making it easy to create console applications that looks like old DOS applications.

Shinobytes.Console.Forms is written in C#, .NET Framework v4.6.1 using Visual Studio 2017.

Future versions may support .net core using ncurses for linux and mac, I'm still exploring that idea.

## License

## Build
Open up `Shinobytes.Console.Forms.sln` in visual studio, 2017 or later. :)

Press `CTRL + SHIFT + B` and voila!
