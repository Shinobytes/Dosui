## Introduction
Want to have some good ol' dos touch to your console applications? We're all bored of the typical consoles as they are now days, am I right?


Shinobytes.Console.Forms is meant to be used for console apps in such a way that System.Windows.Forms are for, well. Windows Forms Applications xD
Although, its slightly more a mix of WPF and Windows Forms, but more the latter right now. Maybe add bindings in the future?
Or even GUI templates inspired by todays javascript frameworks vue/angular and similar? Meh, only time will tell if I ever get THAT much time for it.

Shinobytes.Console.Forms is written in C#, .NET Framework v4.6.1 using Visual Studio 2017
